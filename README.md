The Problem:

> Computer science topics can be hard and studying them inefficiently won't yield you the best results.

The Solution:

> Learnery shows students computer science flashcards through a carefully thought out spatial repetition algorithm!

> Students then decide whether they need more time to study the card or are feeling confident.
